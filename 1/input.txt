Last summer, a group of juvenile sharks took residence in shallow shores of Long Beach, as well as further south off Dana Point and San Clemente.

Earlier this week, a paddleboarder in Manhattan Beach reported seeing a 6-foot-long great white about 20 yards past the Roundhouse Aquarium.

The juvenile sharks that live close to shore are of little danger to the public, experts say, because they eat small catch like stingrays. That's also a reason they may be showing up in big numbers near the shoreline, as beaches like Huntington report an influx of stingrays.

But when the sharks get into the 10-to 12-foot-long range, they start investigating larger mammals to munch onâ€”and not much is currently known about the behavior of these larger sharks.

Two years ago, Maria Korcsmaros nearly lost her life after being bit off Corona del Mar while training for a triathlon in May 2016, and in April 2017 swimmer Leeanne Ericson was severely maimed off San Onofre State Beach. The sharks involved in both attacks were estimated to be at least 10 feet.
